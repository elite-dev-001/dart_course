 Introduction
Dart is a general purpose programming language developed by Google. You can use it to develop web, server, desktop and
mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s easy to learn (especially if you attend my class) and also has great tooling support.

In many ways Dart is a boring language, and that’s a good thing! It means that Dart is fast and easy to pick up. While
Dart does have some unique characteristics, any knowledge you bring in from other object oriented or C-style languages
will immediately be applicable. If you come here as a complete beginner to programming, Dart is a good place to
start. The concepts that you’ll learn in this course will give you a solid foundation in your coding career.

Don’t let Dart’s mundane syntax fool you. Dart is a modern and rapidly evolving language, and the things it allows you
to do are both exciting and even historic in nature. Never before have you been able to create native applications for so many platforms using a single code base.

There’s a good chance you choose this course because of the Flutter UI framework. However, it was no accident that
Flutter chose Dart as its language. The Dart virtual machine allows lightning fast development-time rebuilds, its
JavaScript complier allows you to build for the web, and its ahead-of-time compiler creates fast native applications
across mobile and desktop platforms and even for servers and embedded devices.

It’s no wonder then that developers across the world have taken notice. The language has been climbing the charts for
both fastest growing: https://octoverse.github.com/#toplanguages and most loved https://bit.ly/2Q2ukO0. The wise
developer takes note of industry trends and joins them.

So welcome to this Course!
