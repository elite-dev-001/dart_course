Course 9: Advanced Classes

In Classes, we covered a lot of the foundational elements of classes, but now it’s time to extend that knowledge. Object-oriented programming has captured developers’ imaginations for decades. Just as the name class is inspired
by biological notation, the true beauty of object-oriented programming is how you’re able to elegantly build
connective tissue between your classes. In this course you’ll learn to use tools such as inheritance, interfaces, mixins and extension methods to move beyond simple coding and enter a world of software design.
