Challenges
Before moving on, here are some challenges to test your knowledge of advanced classes. Itâ€™s best if you try to solve them yourself.

Challenge 1: Heavy monotremes
Dart has a class named Comparable, which is used by the the sort method of List to sort its elements. Add a weight field to the Platypus class you made in this lesson. Then make Platypus implement Comparable so that when you have a list of Platypus objects, calling sort on the list will sort them by weight.

Challenge 2: Fake notes
Design an interface to sit between the business logic of your note-taking app and a SQL database. After that, implement a fake database class that will return mock data.

Challenge 3: Time to code
Dart has a Duration class for expressing lengths of time. Make an extension on int so that you can express a duration like so:
    final timeRemaining = 3.minutes;
