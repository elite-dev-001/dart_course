* Challenges
Before moving on, here are some challenges to test your knowledge of functions. Itâ€™s best if you try to solve them yourself.

Challenge 1: Prime time
Write a function that checks if a number is prime.

Challenge 2: Can you repeat that?
Write a function named repeatTask with the following
definition:
    int repeatTask(int times, int input, Function task)

It repeats a given task on input for times number of times.

Pass an anonymous function to repeatTask to square the input of 2 four times. Confirm that you get the result 65536, since 2 squared is 4, 4 squared is 16, 16 squared is 256, and 256 squared is 65536.
