* Increment and decrement

A common operation that youâ€™ll need is to be able to increment or decrement a variable. In Dart, this is achieved like so:
    var counter = 0;
    counter += 1;
    // counter = 1;
    counter -= 1;
    // counter = 0;

The counter variable begins as 0. The increment sets its value to 1, and then the decrement sets its value back to 0.

The += and -= operators are similar to the assignment operator (=), except they also perform an addition or subtraction. They take the current value of the variable, add or subtract the given value, and assign the result back to the variable.

In other words, the code above is shorthand for the following:

    var counter = 0;
    counter = counter + 1;
    counter = counter - 1;

If you only need to increment or decrement by 1, then you  can use the ++ or -- operators:

    var counter = 0;
    counter++; // 1
    counter--; // 0

The *= and /= operators perform similar operations for multiplication and division, respectively:

    double myValue = 10;

    myValue *= 3; // same as myValue = myValue * 3;
    // myValue = 30.0;

    myValue /= 2; // same as myValue = myValue / 2;
    // myValue = 15.0;

Division in Dart produces a result with a type of double, so myValue could not be an int.
