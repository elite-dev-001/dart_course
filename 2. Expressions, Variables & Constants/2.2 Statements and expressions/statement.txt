* Statements and expressions

Two important words that you'll often hear thrown about in programming language documentation are statement and expression. Its helpful to understand the difference between the two.

* Statements

A statement is a command, something you tell the computer to do. In Dart, all simple statements end with a semicolon.You’ve already seen that with the print statement:

    print('Hello, Dart Apprentice reader!');

The semicolon on the right finishes the statement.

In addition to simple statements, Dart also has complex statements and code blocks that use curly braces, but there’s no need to add semicolons after the braces.

One example of a complex statement is the if statement:
    if (someCondition) {
        // code block
    }
No semicolons are needed on the lines with the opening or closing curly braces.

* Expressions

Unlike a statement, an expression doesn’t do something; it is something. That is, an expression is a value, or is something that can be calculated as a value.

Here are a few examples of expressions in Dart:
    42
    3 + 2
    'Hello, Dart Developers'
    x
The values can be numbers, text, or some other type. They can even be variables such as x whose value isn’t known until runtime.
