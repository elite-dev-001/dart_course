* Challenges

Before moving on, here are some challenges to test your knowledge of variables and constants.

Challenge 1: Variables
Declare a constant int called myAge and set it equal to your age. Also declare an int variable called dogs and set that equal to the number of dogs you own. Then imagine you bought a new puppy and increment the dogs variable by one.

Challenge 2: Make it compile
Given the following code:
    age = 16;
    print(age);
    age = 30;
    print(age);

Modify the first line so that the code compiles. Did you use var, int, final or const?

Challenge 3: Compute the answer
Consider the following code:
    const x = 46;
    const y = 10;
Work out what each answer equals when you add the
following lines of code to the code above:
    const answer1 = (x * 100) + y;
    const answer2 = (x * 100) + (y * 100);
    const answer3 = (x * 100) + (y / 10);

Challenge 4: Average rating
Declare three constants called rating1, rating2 and rating3 of type double and assign each a value. Calculate the average of the three and store the result in a constant named averageRating.

Challenge 5: Quadratic equations
A quadratic equation is something of the form

a⋅x  + b⋅x + c = 0.

The values of x which satisfy this can be solved by using the equation

x = (-b   sqrt(b  - 4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a).

Declare three constants named a, b and c of type double. Then calculate the two values for x using the equation above (noting that the   means plus or minus, so one value of x for each). Store the results in constants called root1 and root2 of type double.
