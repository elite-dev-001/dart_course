Course 7: Nullability

You know that game where you try to find the item that doesn’t belong in a list? Here’s one for you:
    horse, camel, pig, cow, sheep, goat

Which one doesn’t belong?

It’s the third one, of course! The other animals are raised by nomadic peoples, but a pig is a farmer’s animal — it doesn’t do so well trekking across the steppe. About now you’re probably muttering to yourself why your answer was just as good — like, a sheep is the only animal with wool, or something similar. If you got an answer that works, good job.
Here’s another one:
    196, 144, 169, 182, 121
Did you get it? The answer is one hundred and eighty-two.
All the other numbers are squares of integers.
One more:
    3, null, 1, 7, 4, 5
And the answer is . . . null! All of the other items in the list are integers, but null isn’t an integer.
What? Was that too easy?
