* Challenges
Before moving on, here are some challenges to test your knowledge of collections. Itâ€™s best if you try to solve them yourself.

Challenge 1: A unique request
Write a function that takes a paragraph of text and returns a collection of unique String characters that the text contains.

Challenge 2: Counting on you
Repeat Challenge 1, but this time have the function return a collection that contains the frequency, or count, of every unique character.

Challenge 3: Mapping users
Create a class called User with properties for id and name. Make a List with three users, specifying any appropriate names and IDs you like. Then write a function that converts your user list to a list of maps whose keys are id and name.
