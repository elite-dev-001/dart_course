Challenges
Before moving on, here are some challenges to test your knowledge of classes and the components that make them up. It’s best if you try to solve them yourself.

Challenge 1: Bert and Ernie
Create a Student class with final firstName and lastName String properties and a variable grade as an int property. Add a constructor to the class that initializes all the properties. Add a method to the class that nicely formats a Student for printing. Use the class to create students bert and ernie with grades of 95 and 85, respectively.

Challenge 2: Spheres
Create a Sphere class with a const constructor that takes a positive length radius as a named parameter. Add getters for the the volume and surface area but none for the radius. Don’t use the dart:math package but store your own version of pi as a static constant. Use your class to find the volume and surface area of a sphere with a radius of 12.
